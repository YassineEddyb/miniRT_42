### What is ray tracing
In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for modeling light 
transport for use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for
generating digital images.

## install

Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/YassineEddyb/miniRT_42 && cd miniRT_42 && make
```
Then run the program with a file as an argument from the scenes folder
```
./miniRT ./scenes/1337.rt
```

## How to use it

You can also create your own scene,
There is three conifg object that are mandate to have:

Ambient
<img src="./images/ambient.png" />

Light
<img src="./images/light.png" />

Camera
<img src="./images/camera.png" />

And foor basic shapes that are (optional, will not entirely cause if you leave it empty you will only see a black window):

Plane
<img src="./images/plane.png" />

Sphere
<img src="./images/sphere.png" />

Cylinder
<img src="./images/cylinder.png" />

Cube

<b>Position: 20,3,0 </b> => x,y,z coordinates <br>
<b>Oreintation: 0,1,0 </b> => 3d normalized orientation vector. In range [-1,1] for each x,y,z axis <br>
<b>Color: 255,0,255 </b> => R,G,B colors in range [0,255] <br>
<b>Shininess: 200</b> => how much the surface shine in range [0,200] <br>
<b>Reflection: 1 </b> => how much the surface reflect in range [0,1] <br>

# How it works?

in case you're wondering how all this works? just loop over all pixels and generate a ray for each one, then see if intersects with any object and calculate the color for this pixel, sounds simple isn't it, well it's not at least for me.

### generating rays
There is a lot of methods to generate rays one of them is
