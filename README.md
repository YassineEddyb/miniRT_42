### What is ray tracing
In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for modeling light 
transport for use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for
generating digital images.

### How it works?

Just loop over all pixels and generate ray for each one then see if intersects with an object and calculate the color of this pixel, sounds simple isn't it, Beleive me it's not.

<b>first we have to generate the ray for each pixel</b>
