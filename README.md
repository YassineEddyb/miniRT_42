### What is ray tracing
In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for modeling light
transport for use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for
generating digital images.

## Install

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/YassineEddyb/miniRT_42 && cd miniRT_42 && make
```
Then run the program with a file as an argument from the scenes folder:
```
./miniRT ./scenes/1337.rt
```

## How to use it:

You can also create your own scene, just create a file with <b>.rt</b> extention and add configure it. <br>
There is three conifg object that are mandatory to have:

- Ambient
<img src="./images/ambient.png" />

- Light
<img src="./images/light.png" />

- Camera
<img src="./images/camera.png" />

And four basic shapes that are (optional, will not entirely cause if you leave it empty you will only see a black window):

- Plane
<img src="./images/plane.png" />

- Sphere
<img src="./images/sphere.png" />

- Cylinder
<img src="./images/cylinder.png" />

- Cube
<img src="./images/cube.png" />

<b>Position: 20,3,0 </b> => x,y,z coordinates <br>
<b>Oreintation: 0,1,0 </b> => 3d normalized orientation vector. In range [-1,1] for each x,y,z axis <br>
<b>Color: 255,0,255 </b> => R,G,B colors in range [0,255] <br>
<b>Shininess: 200</b> => how much the surface shine in range [0,200] <br>
<b>Reflection: 1 </b> => how much the surface reflect in range [0,1] <br>

# How it works?

in case you're wondering how all this works? just loop over all pixels and generate a ray for each one, then see if intersects with any object and calculate the color for this pixel, sounds simple isn't it, well it's not at least for me.

## My explanation
First of all you should be familiar with matrixes and vectors,
check this article from scratchapixel <a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/mathematics-physics-for-computer-graphics/geometry">geometry.</a> <br>

in this lesson well draw a sphere and the same method go for other basic shapes.

### 1- Generating rays
In orther to generate rays in real life you would have to implement a camera but we'll keep thing simple here.

First we'll have to deside how large our window will be:
```
Width = 100
Height = 100
```

We'll assume the ray starts from z -5.
```
vector ray_origin = point(0, 0, -5)
```

```
# assuming Width > Height
AspectRatio = Width / Height;

# for each row of pixels in the canvas
for y = 0 to Width - 1

  # compute the world y coordinate
  world_x = (2 * ((x + 0.5) / Width) - 1) * tan(fov / 2 * M_PI / 180) * AspectRatio; 

  # for each pixel in the row
  for x = 0 to Height - 1
 
    # compute the world x coordinate
    world_y = (1 - 2 * ((y + 0.5) / Height) * tan(fov / 2 * M_PI / 180);

    # describe the point that the ray will target
    vector position = point(world_x, world_y, 1)

    # get ray direction
    vector ray_dir = normalize(ray_dir - ray_origin);

  end for
end for
```

### 2- Ray Sphere intersection
After generating rays we'll see if they intersect with a sphere.

We know the equation of a line:
```
P = O + tD
```
Where :
<ul>
  <li><b>P</b>: a point on the line</li>
  <li><b>O</b>: the origin on the line</li>
  <li><b>t</b>: the scaler just think of it a number</li>
  <li><b>D</b>: the direction of the line</li>
</ul>

We also know the equation of a sphere:

<pre>(x - a)<sup>2</sup> + (y - b)<sup>2</sup> + (z - c)<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup></pre>

Where:
<ul>
  <li><b>a,b,c</b>: the position of the sphere</li>
  <li><b>x,y,z</b>: a point from the sphere</li>
  <li><b>r</b>: the raduis of the shpere</li>
</ul>

Assuming that the sphere postion is on 0,0,0.
<pre>
(x - 0)<sup>2</sup> + (y - 0)<sup>2</sup> + (z - 0)<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup>
x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup>
x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> - r<sup>2</sup> = 0
</pre>

Remember that x,y,z are the cordinates of a point in the sphere so we can write it as
<pre>P<sup>2</sup> - r<sup>2</sup> = 0</pre>

If we replace P with it's value from the equation of a line we get:
<pre>|O + tD|<sup>2</sup> - r<sup>2</sup> = 0</pre>

With the origin of the sphere on 0,0,0 we get
<pre>(tD)<sup>2</sup> - r<sup>2</sup> = 0</pre>

When we expand this equation we get
<pre>(Dt)<sup>2</sup> + 2Dt − R<sup>2</sup> = D<sup>2</sup>t<sup>2</sup> + 2Dt − r<sup>2</sup> = 0</pre>

It looks like:
<pre>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</pre>
Where
<ul>
  <li><b>a</b> => D<sup>2</sup></li>
  <li><b>b</b> => 2D</li>
  <li><b>c</b> => r<sup>2<sup></li>
</ul>

So we can solve it using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula">Quadratic Formula</a>
<pre>t<sub>1,2</sub> = (-b ± √Δ) / 2a</pre>

Where :
```
Δ = b<sup>2<sup> - 4ac
```

- if `Δ > 0` => the ray intersects the sphere in two points
- if `Δ = 0` => the ray intersects the sphere in one points
- if `Δ < 0` => the ray does not intersects with the sphre
