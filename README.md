### What is ray tracing
In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for modeling light 
transport for use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for
generating digital images.

### How it works?

Just loop over all pixels and generate a ray for each one, then see if intersects with any object and calculate the color for this pixel, sounds simple isn't it, well it's not.

<b>First we have to generate the ray for each pixel</b>

here is some resourses
